# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

```
Contract deployed to: 0x9996e4d77059998A729a42aD948e138cBD61109f
```
```
Contract deployed to: 0x6c1c1891Ec33c2460F52af8bbdf214FBf869fdAb
```
